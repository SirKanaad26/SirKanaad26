I'm currently involved in **LLM security research**, exploring prompt injection attacks, adversarial techniques, and building stateful authorization systems for MCP servers. I'm also developing an **ARM ASL (Architecture Specification Language) to Rust compiler**, involving an ANTLR parser integration. I have authored a book and a research paper on Cryptography with everyday objects.
